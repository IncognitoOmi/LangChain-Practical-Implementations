# LangChain Practical Implementations

## Overview
This repository contains practical implementations of various LangChain techniques, including data loading, text splitting, embeddings, and vector databases. The examples demonstrate how to effectively process and manage text data for AI and LLM applications.

## Features
- **Data Loading Techniques**: Methods to ingest data from various sources.
- **Text Splitting Techniques**: Strategies for chunking text to optimize LLM performance.
- **Embeddings**: Using different embedding models to represent text numerically.
- **Vector Databases**: Storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently for similarity search
